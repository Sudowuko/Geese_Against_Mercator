Seeing how fires can impact both urban ecology and protected areas, our web app LightorFight takes reports from citizens and displays all reported wildfires on a map, 
allowing users and firefighters to see if their area is at risk. Our app calculates the density of wildfires across the country, evacuation routes from the area at a 
certain amount of time away and allows for buffers to be placed around the point of a hazardous fire.

LightorFight uses an ArcGIS Survey 123 form to collect wildfire reports from citizens about the fires that they report. This is then uploaded to the ArcGIS Online cloud. 
This allows for hazards to be updated in real time. LightorFight uses ArcGIS Web AppBuilder to easily calculate the density of wildfire reports in an area, show users 
driving times to potential evacuation destinations, and buffer the area of a hazard depending on its predicted extent.

LightorFight was designed to be a user-friendly way to aid in the preservation of protected areas and urban ecological systems during times of crisis during wildfires. 
It allows users to easily analyze if their area is at risk and evacuate and allows firefighters to make the choice of preserving a protected area or to let the fire run 
its natural course.
